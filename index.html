<h1><em><strong>Video Games</strong></em></h1>
<p>Ive been playing video games since as long as I remembered. In the Dominican Republic my uncles who live in<br />
the State's would send consoles and video games to me and my mom in the DR. The first console I owned was a <br />
Nintendo Wii which my uncle sent from the US, the wii was the first time I started playing video games. Things like<br />
Wii Sports, Super Smash Bros Brawl, and Super Mario. After that my mom and I moved to the United States which<br />
introduced me into even more videos game since we lived at my grandma's house where my uncle lived at.</p>
<p>My uncle introduced me the PlayStation 3 console which was Relatively new at the time. I would see him play all day after he <br />
  came back from School and work. He would mainly play Call of Duty games which I should have not been watching but I sure did.<br />
I instantly fell in love with the Series after seeing him and his friend play Online matches between each-other.</p>
